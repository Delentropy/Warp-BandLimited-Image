# Warp-BandLimited-Image
The Search for Perfection and Fast Fourier Implementations

The conventional approach to high fidelity warping of signals and images is based on sinc interpolation framed in the temporal or spatial domain respectively.  It is known that non-affine warping destroys any strict band-limitedness. We establish a complementary approach in the Fourier domain of an image. With an appropriate image decomposition it is possible to precisely compute the effect of non-affinity on the Fourier modes.  Unexpected parallels with wave propagation and catastrophe theory are revealed.  We present an algorithm for computing near-perfect warped images based on the idea of in-situ phase modulation, eschewing explicit interpolation.
